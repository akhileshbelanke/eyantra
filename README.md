This is eyantra robotics competition 2018 project.

This is simulator to develop and verify the working of path planning algorithm for robots to manuever on the grid.

Project Tasks:

Done - Implement opening tikinter, drawing grid, drawing circles. <br>
Done - Implement drawing car.  <br>
Done - Implement moving single car in straight line path. <br>
Done - Defining classes - gui, car, plant and algorithm. <br>
Done - Implement adjust car facing, car head and reorientation logic. <br>
Done - Implement moving cars on a fixed path. <br>
Done - Defining state machine for car. <br>
Done - Implement moving cars on fixed path as per the state machine. <br>
Done - Add plants randomly to the grid. <br>
Done - Implement sensing logic to sense which plant is placed in the four squares around the node. <br>
Done - Collect all the sensed data in that paricular car object. <br>
Done - Feed or Weed the plants on the fixed path as per appropriate color. <br>
Done - Data collection and logging. <br>
Done - Data broadcasting mechanism immediatly as the car finds the plant of other car. <br>
Done - Modify data logging mechanism to broadcast/collect data of plants which are not feeded/weeded by the sensing car. <br>
Done - Implement path as you get the information of where are the appropriate plants located in the grid <br>
Done - Add System states - dataCollection, pathPlanning, Execution, Stop.  <br>
Done - keep two different paths static and dynamic - static path for data collection and dynamic path for execution. <br>
Done - Update dynamic path according to algorithm. <br>
Done - Move on dynamic path. <br> 
Done - Path planning shortest path algorithm over grid. Implement travelling salesman algorithm over grid. <br>
       Done - a. Calculate distance matrix. <br>
       Done - b. Implement Bellman Held Karp algorithm. Output will be nodes to visit in order. <br>
       Done - c. Select 1 of 4 corner, for each node in the list. <br>
       Done - d. Execute on this path. <br>
```
Todo - Obstacle avoidance algorithm. <br>
Todo - Adding appropriate delays - sensing, feeding, weeding, and turning.
